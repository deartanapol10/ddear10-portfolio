# Dear's Portfolio
Data Science Projects completed by me for self learning and hobby.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/LendingClub.com.ipynb): By using lending data, I try to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full by a Decision Tree Model or a Random Forest model.
	- [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb): By using unlabeled Universities data, I try to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public by a KMeans Clustering algorithm.
	- [K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/KNN%20Project.ipynb): By using a provided data from Pieriandata.com to build a K Nearest Neighbors model and use the elbow method to pick a good K value.
	- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20NYC.ipynb): By using Ecommerce data to build a Linear Regression model and predict online clothing store's income.
	- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Advertising.ipynb): By using an advertising data(provided data from Pieriandata.com), I try to build a Logistic Regression model that will predict whether or will not click on an ad based off the features of that user.
	- [Natural-language Processing](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/NLP%20Project%20yelp.ipynb): I downloaded the Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle and try to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews by using Natural-language Processing.
	- [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/deartanapol10/ddear10-portfolio/blob/master/SVM%20iris.ipynb): I imported the famous Iris flower data set from seaborn and try to classify the three different species of iris flowers by using Support Vector Machine and then I tuned the parameters by using GridSearch.
